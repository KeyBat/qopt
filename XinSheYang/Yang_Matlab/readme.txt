The files included in the zip file (Yang_matlab.zip) are 
the matlab programs in the above book.

Notes:

1) All these files are demo only, and they should work in
   Matlab or Octave.

2) As metaheuristic algorithms are stochastic, results 
   should be explained using statistic measures such as 
   mean and standard deviation.

Notice:

  While every attempt is made to ensure that the information 
  and programs in this book and zip files are correct, 
  no liability can be accepted by the author or publisher for 
  loss, damage or injury caused by any errors in, or omission 
  from, the information given.
