 FORMULA OPTIONS

 The program either reads an existing formula in conjunctive normal
 form, 

 -l <formula>	loads formula	

 or it generates a new random formula with parameters specified by: 
	
 -n <integer>	number of variables
 -m <integer>	number of clauses
 -a <float>	clause / variable ratio
 -s <integer>	random seed (default 1; 0 use clock)


 SOLVING OPTIONS

 By default we use a pseudo-temperature y = 2 but a different value 
 can be set by

 -y <float>       set the inverse pseudo-temperature
 -Y               run with runtime optimized pseudo-temperature
 -u <integer>     the update rate for Y

 To specify backtracking ratio (default no backtracking) use

 -B <float>        backtrack with a given rate within [0, 0.5]

 Other options are 

 -f <integer>     number of variables fixed per step
 -% <float>       percentage of variables fixed per step (%)
 -e <float>       criterion for convergence
 -i <integer>     maximum number of iterations until convergence
 -H               rank the variables according to the average
                  local field value (experimental)


 OUTPUT

 Five levels of verbosity are available:

 0 (default)	almost no output, just simplification result
 		in output.tmp.out file
 1 (-v)		number of free variables written as progress indicator
                in output.tmp.out file
 2 (-vv)	details about convergence (smileys and dots) 
		in output.tmp.out file and replay.tmp.out file with 
		information about fixing
 3 (-vvv)	list of ALL local fields appended to output.tmp.out file
 4 (-vvvv)	list of ALL local fields and cavity surveys 
		in the output.tmp.out file (use with care, huge output)

 The parameters for verbosity control are: 

 -R 		replay file
 -F             print fields
 -E             print u-surveys
 -v             increase verbosity (0 to 4)
 
 
 MISCELLANEOUS

 -/		stop after first convergence
 -h		print help
 -s <integer>   random seed (default 1; 0 use clock)
